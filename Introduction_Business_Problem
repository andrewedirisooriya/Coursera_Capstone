Introduction/Business Problem:

Question 1
Objective: compare the neighbourhoods of New York and Toronto and determine how similar or dissimilar they are.
Using the Foursquare API I will explore the most common venue categories in each neighbourhood and then use this feature to group the neighbourhoods into clusters – using K means. After which I will use the Folium library to visualise the neighbourhoods in both New York and Toronto along with their emerging clusters.

Question 2
Objective: A restaurant owner is looking to open a new Italian restaurant in New York, the objective is to recommend the best location to open the venue.
Target audience: customers of the Italian restaurant
Stakeholders: restaurant owner
Using the Foursquare API I will explore the Italian restaurants in each neighbourhood and then use this feature to group the restaurants into clusters – using K means. After which I will use the Folium library to visualise the restaurants in New York along with their emerging clusters.
The distribution of Italian restaurants will help the restaurant owner determine the best location to open the new venue.
